This type of attack attempts to exploit the PHP application's deserialization process to execute arbitrary code or carry out unintended actions on the server.

Mitigation Strategies
To defend against PHP object injection and similar attacks, consider the following strategies:

Disable PHP Object Deserialization: Avoid using unserialize() on user-controlled input, as it is inherently insecure.

Use JSON Serialization: When exchanging data structures, use JSON encoding/decoding (json_encode()/json_decode()) instead of PHP serialization.

Sanitize and Validate Inputs: Rigorously check all user inputs to ensure they do not contain unexpected or malicious data.

Implement Access Controls: Limit access to sensitive functions and data. Ensure only authorized users can access potentially dangerous functionality.

Environment Hardening: Follow best practices for server security, such as disabling unused PHP functions and limiting file permissions.

Code Reviews and Audits: Regularly review and audit your codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
